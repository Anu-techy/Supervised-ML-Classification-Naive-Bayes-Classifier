**Conditional probability**

P(A|B) is probability of event A knowing that event B has already occured

**1. What is the probability of getting a queen in cards**

**Soln:** There are 4 queens out of 52 cards. Hence Probability = 4/52 = 1/13

**2. You pick a random card, its a diamond. now What is the probability of that card being a queen?**

**Soln:** Total diamonds = 13, Queen = 1

Conditional Probability p(queen|diamond) = 1/13

**3. You pick a card, it is a queen, What is the probability of that card being diamond?**

**Soln:** There are 4 queens, out off which diamond queen is 1

Conditional Probability p(diamond|queen) = 1/4
